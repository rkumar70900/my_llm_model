       "'Here’s a concise summary of the key points from Rajesh Kumar Bandaru’s Statement of Purpose for a PhD in Computer Science:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**1. Core Interest & Motivation**  \\n- Believes AI models should be **runnable locally** (especially on edge devices with limited hardware).  \\n- First encountered the challenge of running large open-source models locally → sparked interest in **quantization** as the most impactful technique for reducing memory, computation, and inference cost while preserving accuracy.\\n\\n**2. Technical Focus: Quantization Techniques**  \\n- Studied data types (integer vs. float), and advanced quantization methods: **GPTQ, AWQ, QLoRA**.  \\n- Authored technical articles:  \\n  - *“How Does Matrix Multiplication Happen in LLMs?”* — on LLM internals and inference trade-offs.  \\n  - *“Making LLMs Smaller: The Story of Gpace* — on post-training quantization techniques (lazy batch updates, Cholesky decomposition).  \\n- Built **GGUF Model Explorer** to inspect and understand quantized model metadata and storage.\\n\\n**3. Academic Background**  \\n- Master’s in Computer Science (Specialization: Computational Intelligence) — focused on machine learning, deep learning, optimization, and algorithmic problem-solving.  \\n- Hands-on project: Built a **decoder-based transformer LLM from scratch** using PyTorch, exploring attention mechanisms and matrix operations.\\n\\n**4. Edge AI & Robotics Experience**  \\n- Built a **3D-printed robotic arm** with Raspberry Pi, camera, and Hailo AI module — deployed lightweight object detection for edge inference.  \\n- Explored **robotics + AI integration**, emphasizing practical deployment.\\n\\n**5. Professional Experience**  \\n- **Data Automation Engineer**: Engineered end-to-end automation workflows using Python, Playwright, Azure — automating ETL, Jira→job conversion, and containerized deployments.  \\n- Strengthened skills in **reliable, hands-free system design** — directly applicable to edge AI deployment pipelines.\\n\\n**6. Alignment with PhD Program**  \\n- Strongly aligned with the lab’s research in:  \\n  - **Efficient & Secure Machine Learning**  \\n  - **Edge AI**  \\n  - **Adaptive and secure AI deployment on edge devices**  \\n- Prior work in LLMs, robotics, and low-resource systems provides a solid foundation to contribute.\\n\\n**7. Future Research Goals**  \\n- Host a quantized QWEN model locally via llama.cpp → compare performance with API-based models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) across text, multi-modal, and PDF QA tasks.  \\n- Experiment with tokenization, hyperparameters, and **custom GPU kernels/inference engines** for real-time deployment.  \\n- Long-term: Explore **domain adaptation, 3D-vision, and edge AI holistically** — developing lightweight, adaptable models for dynamic environments.\\n\\n**8. Personal Traits & Approach**  \\n- Highly **self-motivated, curious, and hands-on**.  \\n- Learns by **building and testing**, with a disciplined schedule.  \\n- Eager to bring this mindset to the lab, bridging theory and practical deployment of efficient, secure AI systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**In short**: Rajesh is driven by the goal of making AI models deployable on edge devices through advanced quantization and efficient inference. His blend of academic rigor, hands-on projects, robotics, and professional automation experience positions him to contribute meaningfully to research in efficient, secure, and adaptive edge AI — especially in the context of decentralized systems.'"

       "  'qwen_text': '**The Dragon and the Wizard**\\n\\nIn the mist-shrouded kingdom of Eldermere, where ancient trees whispered secrets to the wind and rivers sang lullabies to the stars, there lived a wizard named Elion. He was known for his silver hair, his ever-open books, and his uncanny ability to summon storms from mere gestures. But Elion was not a man of power—he was a man of patience, of quiet wisdom, of quiet courage.\\n\\nOne autumn evening, as the last golden leaves drifted to the earth, Elion wandered to the Whispering Peaks, where the legends spoke of a dragon named Veyra. Veyra was no ordinary beast. She was said to be the last of her kind—a fire-wreathed guardian whose breath could melt mountains, whose eyes held the sky’s sorrow.\\n\\nElion had come to seek her, not to conquer, but to understand. He believed dragons were more than myth, more than fire and fury. He thought they were the keepers of forgotten truths.\\n\\nHe climbed the jagged ridge, his boots crunching on brittle moss, and found her perched atop a crumbling spire of obsidian. Her scales glowed like molten amber, her wings, folded like ancient banners, shimmered with twilight hues. And her eyes—deep, ancient, and full of questions.\\n\\n“You are the wizard who seeks the dragon,” she said, her voice like wind chimes in a storm. “Why?”\\n\\nElion smiled, though his eyes held a tremor. “Because I believe dragons are more than fire. I believe they are the keepers of stories. And stories, Veyra… they’re fading.”\\n\\nVeyra tilted her head. “Fading? From what?”\\n\\n“The magic of the world,” Elion whispered. “It’s weakening. The old songs, the old spells, the old truths… they’re slipping through our fingers like sand.”\\n\\nVeyra let out a long, slow sigh—a sound like a thousand rivers slowing their pace. “You seek me. But I seek you.”\\n\\nElion knelt, offering a small vial of starlit water, the very essence of the sky’s memory. “I offer this. I offer my silence. I offer my questions.”\\n\\nShe drank it. And in that moment, the world trembled—not with fire, but with memory. The ancient forests, the lost cities, the names of forgotten kings—each whispered back to them.\\n\\n“Magic is not power,” Veyra said, her voice now softer, warmer, like the first rays of dawn. “It is listening. It is remembering. It is choosing to believe.”\\n\\nElion stood. He turned to the horizon, where the sun dipped behind mountains of time.\\n\\n“You are not my enemy,” he said. “You are my teacher.”\\n\\nAnd so, the wizard and the dragon walked side by side, not to conquer the world, but to remember it.\\n\\nThey became guardians of the stories—the ones that had been lost, the ones that still lived, the ones that would be told, again, and again.\\n\\nAnd for centuries, the kingdom of Eldermere would be woven with the songs of a dragon and a wizard, who had learned that the greatest magic was not in fire, but in trust.\\n\\n—**The End—**\\n\\n*(And the story? It’s still being told.)*',\n",

Despite their differing natures, the two had formed an unlikely friendship that had endured for many years.\\n\\nEridor had saved Drakon from a group of dragon hunters who sought to slay him for his valuable scales, while Drakon had assisted Eridor in fending off dark creatures that threatened the land. Together, they had become a formidable duo, feared and respected by all who knew of their alliance.\\n\\nOne day, a dark sorcerer known as Malakar arrived in Arindor, seeking to overthrow the kingdom and plunge it into darkness. Eridor and Drakon knew they had to act quickly to stop him, for Malakar's powers were great and his army of dark creatures was vast.\\n\\nAs they prepared for battle, Eridor enchanted Drakon with a powerful spell that enhanced his already formidable strength and abilities. Drakon, now imbued with magical energy, soared into the sky and unleashed a torrent of flames upon Malakar's army, decimating their ranks with ease.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Eridor used his mastery of elemental magic to bind Malakar in chains of pure energy, rendering him powerless to wield his dark sorcery. Together, the wizard and the dragon fought back the forces of darkness, driving Malakar and his minions from Arindor once and for all.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Eridor and Drakon stood victorious, their bond stronger than ever. The people of Arindor hailed them as heroes, grateful for their courage and sacrifice in protecting their land.\\n\\nAnd so, the wizard and the dragon continued to roam the wilds of Arindor, their friendship enduring for eternity as they fought alongside each other, defending the realm from all who dared to threaten its peace.\",\n",

Think of them like light switches: off (0) or on (1).\\n\\nThat’s how regular computers work — they do everything by turning bits on and off in different combinations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Now imagine a “quantum computer” — which uses something called “qubits.”**\\n\\nQubits are like bits, but they can be **0, 1, or both at the same time** — kind of like a coin that’s spinning in the air, not yet landed. This is called **superposition**.\\n\\nAlso, qubits can be “tied together” — like two coins that are always the same (if you flip them together, they both land heads or both tails). This is called **entanglement**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Why does this matter?**\\n\\nBecause of these weird quantum rules, a quantum computer can try **many possible answers at once** — like a super-powered guesser. That’s super useful for solving problems that would take normal computers forever.\\n\\nFor example:\\n- Simulating molecules (for new medicines)\\n- Optimizing delivery routes\\n- Breaking certain types of encryption (also, which is good to know for security!)\\n\\n---\\n\\n**But here’s the catch:**\\n\\nQuantum computers are still very new and tricky.
